    EpyNN is a production-ready but first Educational python resource for Neural Networks. EpyNN is designed for Supervised Machine Learning (SML) approaches by means of Neural Networks.
    
## Intermediate/Advanced Deep Learning 🤓
- [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville (2016) `[book 📚]`

    If you want to understand every detail of how a system can learn and how deep learning models work then this is the book. This book requires you to be familiar with basic mathematical and machine learning concepts, and if you're not, there are also introductory chapters to help you get started.
    
- [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans) in Coursera from deeplearning.ai `[online course 👩🏻‍💻]`
    
    Another great resource from deeplearning.ai for those interested in understanding how GANs work and how you can apply them. Also, you can check the expert panel discussion [GANs for Good](https://youtu.be/9d4jmPmTWmc) hosted in celebration of the launch of this specialization.
    
    
## Reinforcement Learning 🤖

- [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) in Coursera from University of Alberta `[online course 👩🏻‍💻]`

    Here you'll have the chance to learn the foundations of Reinforcement Learning and put them into practice through programming assignments. During the course, you'll be able to go through some chapters of the famous Reinforcement Learning book from Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto with the instructors.
    
- [Reinforcement Learning Lecture Series 2021](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/reinforcement-learning-series-2021) by DeepMind x UCL `[lectures 👨🏻‍🏫]`

    In 13 lectures, DeepMind Researchers go from the basics of RL and planning in sequential decision problems to more advanced topics and modern deep RL algorithms.
    
    
## MLOps ⚙️
- [Machine Learning Engineering for Production](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops) in Coursera by deeplearning.ai `[online course 👩🏻‍💻]`

    MLOps is becoming a very hot topic in AI, along with a more "data-centric" approach, but it is still not a reality in most companies working in AI. This 4 course specialization focuses on the engineering aspect of Machine Learning and has a lot of practical bits of advices and good practices. For a glimpse of the topics being discussed in these courses, check out Andrew Ng's thoughts on [MLOps: From Model-centric to Data-centric AI](https://youtu.be/06-AZXmwHjo). 

- [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com) `[online course 👩🏻‍💻]`

    16 weeks course taught by Sergey Karayev, Josh Tobin, and Pieter Abbeel - all PhDs from UC Berkeley. It is assumed that you are already familiar with the basics of deep learning. The course focuses on the rest of the process of creating production deep learning systems, practical concerns you should have, and what tools you can use.
